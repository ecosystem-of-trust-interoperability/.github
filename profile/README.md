# The Ecosystem of Trust interoperability working group

A collaborative alliance across government, industry and academia which is:

1. running a sequence of international trade oriented interoperability workshops
2. co-designing and co-creating a definition for interoperability that may be commonly understood and used within the context of international trade
3. co-designing and co-creating an interoperability framework
4. co-designing, co-creating and running an open, scalable, extensible, repeatable and sustainable model for information sharing
5. co-designing and co-creating the protocols and governance frameworks necessary to create and scale the EoT model

## About

Information about interop workshops, information captured during workshops and co-design material for the Interoperability Working Group will reside in a üîí **private** incubator repository to which participants in the group will be invited. As content matures into models, designs, protocols and frameworks it will be **migrated** to üì¢ **public** repositories once agreement is obtained from all required parties.
